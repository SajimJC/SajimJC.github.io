Silent Installation Progress 202501 

## Progress

The ISO image of Class 1/2/3 has been packaged. It is now undergoing limited internal testing. 
Some optional or open-source software for replacing commercial software are also packed, but not listed in this post.

## Problem

Some commercial software packaged with **InstallShield** can be challenging to deploy silently using conventional methods. These methods include searching for silent installation switches, recording a setup.iss file, extracting the EXE package, or monitoring the %temp% directory for installation files. In such cases, alternative approaches may need to be explored for successful silent deployment.

## Overview

The progress details are outlined below:

1. Done: Already completed.
2. Semi-automation: Silent installation with some required manual steps.
3. N/A: Not applicable to this process.
4. Partial: Additional settings are required for enhancement.
5. No: Configuration settings must be completed to enable functionality.
6. Default: Configuration settings are adhered to the software default parameters.
7. Ongoing: The silent installation code for this software is in progress.
